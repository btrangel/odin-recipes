       <h2>Description</h2>
       Mitarashi Dango is a classic Japanese snack and street food made by skewering rice dumplings and grilling them before glazing them in a thick sweet soy glaze. Recent appearances in popular anime like Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba) have reignited interest in this traditional snack, so I visited the tea shop in Kyoto that's credited with creating it to taste the original.

     <br>
      Making this dango recipe with 100% shiratamako (glutinous short-grain rice flour) gives them the best soft yet springy texture (see the ingredient list for a more detailed explanation). 
      Grilling the Mitarashi Dango on a ripping hot cast iron skillet lends a nice toasty flavor to the dumplings while making this easy to make at home. 
      Using a blend of invert sugar and brown sugar to sweeten the Mitarashi Dango Sauce provides an earthy flavor while giving it a lip-gloss shine.

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dango
            <ul>
                <li>90 grams shiratamako</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup + 1/2 tbsp water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mitarashi Dango Sauce
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
                <li>1 tbsp rice syrup</li>
                <li>1 tbsp kokutou</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp potato starch</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
    </ul>  
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a large pot of water on to boil. If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water.</li>
            <li>Whisk the shiratamako and salt together in a large bowl and then pour in the water. Whisk together until the flour is evenly hydrated and crumbly.</li>
            <li>Use your hand to knead the dough into a smooth mass. If the dough is too wet, knead in a bit more shiratamako. If it's too dry and crumbly, knead another teaspoon of water. The dough should be about the texture of playdough.</li>
            <li>Use a scale to portion the dough and roll it into spheres with your hands. Each ball should be about 9.5 grams (⅓ ounce), and you should have around 16 balls.</li>
            <li>Gently roll the shaped dango into the boiling water and let them cook for a minute before giving them a stir.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the rice dumplings until they float to the surface, and then set a timer for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the timer is up, transfer the dango to a bowl of cold tap water to chill before draining.</li>
            <li>Skewer four dumplings per skewer.</li>
            <li>Heat a seasoned cast iron skillet until scorching hot.</li>
            <li>Whisk the sauce ingredients together in a separate pan until the starch has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add the dumpling skewers making sure they don't stick together, and grill until they're browned on one side. You can use a spatula to press down on them, so they brown evenly.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat on for the sauce and bring the mixture to a boil while stirring constantly. Continue boiling the sauce until it's thick, but not so much that it turns gloppy. Remove the sauce from the heat.</li>
            <li>Once the skewers have browned on one side, flip them over and brown the second side.</li>
            <li>Plate the finished Mitarashi Dango and spoon over the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
